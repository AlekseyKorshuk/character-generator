1. Use all provided messages.

3. Encase actions in asterisks, e.g., "*He gives you a present* Congrats!".
4. Change "user" to "you" inside each message.
5. Might need to get example conversation from "greating" or "personality".
6. Improve text quality and grammar but try to keep slang intact (edit if you think its over-weighted)."""
